    "keywords": "Application Hierarchy and Interitence Introduction This article explains how hierarchies are maintained in the Emgage platform and how you can make use of this feature to build efficient applications. In the Emgage platform, every app is associated to a parent. Under every new app, further apps can be created and so on. This hierarchical structure can be extended to any level as per requirement. Application Hierarchy From the Dashboard, navigate to; Left Nav Bar and click the Select App button. You will see a screen as shown below. At the root, you will see a system defined app called Global . Global app is the parent of all apps created in Emgage . All child apps inherit properties, resources or controls defined in the Global app. If you want to create an app that inherits resources defined in the Global app only, then choose the Global app and refer to Create Application Guide for create a new application. Endless hierarchy levels can be created in Emgage . Refer to the above screen, the app Project- Chip Design is created under the parent named Customer - Intel , which is created under the parent Cybersecurity Provider . Note that the parent application named Cybersecurity Provider lies under the source app named Global . No app can be created above Global . Resource Inheritance in Application Hierarchy In simple terms, Inheritance means reception of resources or properties from parent to the child. When a child app is created in Emgage , all properties, resources or controls of the parent are automatically available in the child app. New properties, resources or controls created in the child app are available to the child app only and are not reflected in any other app or its parent app. Refer to the Hierarchy Levels in the figure above, the Inheritance of app resources for the Project- Chip Design are; All the resources available in the app named Customer - Intel . All the resources available in the app named Cybersecurity Provider . All the resources available in the app named Global . The Inheritance of app resources for the Customer - Intel are; All the resources available in the app named Cybersecurity Provider . All the resources available in the app named Global . Global is the parent of all apps."

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
